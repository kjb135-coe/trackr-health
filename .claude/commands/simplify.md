# Simplify Code

Review recent changes and simplify the code without changing functionality.

## Focus Areas

1. Remove unnecessary complexity
2. Reduce duplication
3. Improve readability
4. Remove dead code
5. Simplify conditionals
6. Use more idiomatic patterns

## Steps

1. Run `git diff HEAD~1` to see recent changes
2. Identify areas that can be simplified
3. Make simplifications while preserving functionality
4. Run type check to verify nothing broke

Do NOT change behavior. Only improve code quality.
