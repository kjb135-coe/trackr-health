# Run Tests

Run the test suite and report results.

## Steps

1. Run `npm test` (or the appropriate test command for this project)
2. If tests fail, analyze the failures
3. Report summary of results

For this Expo/React Native project:
- TypeScript check: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Lint if configured: `npm run lint`
- Unit tests if configured: `npm test`

Do NOT ask for confirmation. Just run the tests.
