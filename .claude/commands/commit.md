# Commit and Push

Commit all staged and unstaged changes with a good commit message, then push.

## Steps

1. Run `git status` to see changes
2. Run `git diff` to understand what changed
3. Stage all changes with `git add -A`
4. Write a concise, descriptive commit message following conventional commits (feat:, fix:, chore:, etc.)
5. Commit the changes
6. Push to the current branch

Do NOT ask for confirmation. Just do it.
